of Wall Street's Most Heavily Shorted Stocks","description":"\"short interest\" is one of the most interesting pieces of stock data that you might pay little or no attention to. but this little metric of negative sentiment, while popular among traders, can be valuable even to buy-and-hold investors who never want to place a single bearish bet.if you believe a stock will rise, you buy it. easy. but what if you're bearish on a company's prospects and want to profit off that belief? a popular technique is short selling: to sell a stock short, you borrow shares so you can immediately turn around and sell them. you wait for shares to fall in price, then buy them back and return those shares to the lender. your profit is the difference between the price you sold and the price you bought back.but that gamble can go wrong - to the delight of bullish investors. short sellers incur losses when the stock's price goes higher. also, time is against you when you short a stock, because you pay interest when you borrow shares. if you want to exit your short trade, you have to buy back shares, which in turn drives the stock price higher. that might force other short sellers to cut their losses, leading to a virtuous cycle of buying called a \"short squeeze.\"that's why short interest (how many shares are currently sold short to bet against a company) matters. there's no concrete level, but anything above 10% of the float, which is the number of shares available for public trading, is worth watching. if you're a conservative, buy-and-hold investor who hates volatility, you might want to avoid stocks with high short interest. if you're an aggressive investor, however, you might consider buying these stocks in the hope that a small bit of positive news will trigger a short squeeze, netting large returns in a short time.here, we'll look at seven heavily shorted stocks to watch. these companies have short interest ranging anywhere from 14% to 96%, and many of them are the kinds of hot-moving growth stocks that are typical among short-selling targets. see also: the 20 best stocks to buy for

Games Learn How to Take More of Your Cash","description":"(bloomberg opinion) -- ea micro-transactions: they\u2019re in the game.\u00a0if you\u2019re like me, you grew up hearing a similar catchphrase, likely while playing the fifa\u00a0soccer video game on an earlier\u00a0iteration of the playstation system. ea refers, of course, to electronic arts inc., the game publisher\u2019s parent company, which nowadays is valued north of $30 billion. fifa is still its most popular franchise, but selling a disc at a local gamestop is no longer the primary way companies like ea make money. increasingly, the industry model is centered on digital downloads, subscriptions, mobile play, live online events and \u2014\u00a0for\u00a0the big moneymaker \u2014 tiny in-game purchases, also known as micro-transactions. that notable shift\u00a0makes a year\u00a0like 2020 an interesting one.\u00a0expected later this year are the launches of sony corp.\u2019s playstation 5 and microsoft corp.\u2019s xbox series x, the next generation of video-game consoles (and potentially\u00a0the last, as gaming shifts to the cloud). traditionally, that would mark a pretty important stage in the business cycle for ea and its publishing rivals, such as activision blizzard inc. and take-two interactive software inc.; new consoles need new games, which means a big sales boost is on the way. but this time, it comes\u00a0without the lull that usually occurs leading up to it. and that\u2019s thanks to \u2014\u00a0gamers, you love to hear it \u2014\u00a0micro-transactions.\u00a0\u201cbecause of all that ancillary revenue, primarily from micro-transactions, games aren\u2019t as tied to console cycles as they used to be,\u201d michael pachter, an analyst for wedbush securities, said in a phone interview.\u00a0ea\u2019s quarterly results released last week showed that the category it calls live services, which include\u00a0in-game purchases, was the biggest driver of net revenue, bringing in\u00a0$677 million. that compares with $469 million from\u00a0packaged goods (e.g., physical discs) and $286 million from full-game downloads. activision blizzard and take-two are both scheduled to report their earnings feb. 6.live services can extend the useful life of a game, giving ea more opportunities to make money from users long after the\u00a0initial purchase. a popular version of this is fifa ultimate team, which is a bit like fantasy soccer in that users\u00a0try to assemble the best team possible by paying for points that can then buy packs\u00a0of players, hopefully some star names. according to one fan site, a \u201csilver players pack\u201d costs the equivalent of 83 cents, while a \u201cjumbo rare players pack\u201d is about $17.\u00a0for a different kind of example of a micro-transaction:\u00a0activision blizzard\u2019s world of warcraft\u00a0players can buy argi, a digital pet, for $10. there\u2019s also a\u00a0call of duty: modern warfare\u00a0\u201cbattle pass bundle\u201d for the equivalent of\u00a0$24, according to\u00a0the washington post.ea got off to a rough start with\u00a0micro-transactions. in 2017, the company\u2019s\u00a0star wars battlefront ii\u00a0was originally developed with virtual loot\u00a0boxes that could\u00a0enhance a character\u2019s\u00a0abilities.\u00a0it turned into a major controversy, the concern being that when in online-multiplayer mode, users\u00a0who shelled out more money were\u00a0more likely to win. amid the backlash, ea got rid of the loot boxes and instead left micro-transactions for benign cosmetic upgrades.then in november, ea released star wars jedi: fallen order to a much warmer reception. the company originally predicted it would sell 6 million to 8 million units by the end of march, but it has already surpassed that number and now sees 10 million in sales. and this time, it\u2019s treading carefully\u00a0in bringing live services to the game. \u201cwe\u2019re very conscious about not trying to get people to spend beyond what their spend levels are,\u201d blake jorgensen, ea\u2019s chief operating officer and chief financial offer, said on the earnings call.on top of the success of live services, ea \u2014 along with its competitors \u2014 is preparing to introduce new hit games for the next-gen consoles, such as a new version\u00a0of battlefield\u00a0and another\u00a0star wars. walt disney co.\u2019s lucasfilm makes the movies, but for now, the force is with ea.to contact the author of this story: tara lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netto contact the editor responsible
